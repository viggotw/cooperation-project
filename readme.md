# Co-op programming example
This project is an exercise in co-op programming. The backend is created using Python by Viggo Tellefsen Wivestad, and the frontend is created using HTML/CSS/JS by me, Synne Marie Kil Olsen.

## How to run the project
Open two terminals, one for the backend and one for the frontend.

### Terminal 1 (start the Python backend)
```bash
cd backend
set FLASK_APP=app.py  # For windows
flask run
```

### Terminal 2 (start the frontend)
```bash
cd frontend
python -m http.server
```
